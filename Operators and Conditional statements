if year % 4 ==0:
    print(year, "is leap year")
else:
        print(year, "is not a leap year")

6)Write a Python program to concatenate two strings entered by the user.
One = int(input("enter a number: "))
Two = int(input("enter a number: "))
Total = (One + Two)
print("The Output is: ", +Total)

7)Write a Python program to find the maximum of three numbers entered by the user.
a = 1
b = 50
c = 10
print(max(a,b,c))

8)Write a Python program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa based on user input.

9)Write a Python program to check if a character entered by the user is a vowel, consonant, or neither using conditional statements.
alphabet = input("Enter a letter: ")
if alphabet in ('a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U'):
    print(alphabet," is a vowel.")
else:
    print(alphabet,"is a consonant.")

10)Write a Python program to determine the type of triangle based on the lengths of its sides (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene).

x = int(input("enter the value of x: "))
y = int(input("enter the value of y: "))
z = int(input("enter the value of z: "))
if x == y == z:
   print("Equilateral triangle") 
  else:
      if x==y or y==z or x==z:
       print("Isosceles triangle")
       else:
    print("Scalene triangle")

11)Write a Python program to determine the roots of a quadratic equation entered by the user using conditional statements.

12)Write a Python program to calculate the electricity bill for a user based on the units consumed using conditional statements (consider different slab rates).


13)Write a Python program to determine the grade of a student based on their percentage score (A for 90% or above, B for 80% to 89%, etc.).
sub1=int(input("Enter marks of the first subject: "))
sub2=int(input("Enter marks of the second subject: "))
sub3=int(input("Enter marks of the third subject: "))
sub4=int(input("Enter marks of the fourth subject: "))
sub5=int(input("Enter marks of the fifth subject: "))
avg=(sub1+sub2+sub3+sub4+sub4)/5
if(avg>=90):
    print("Grade: A")
elif(avg>=80&avg<89):
    print("Grade: B")
elif(avg>=70&avg<79):
    print("Grade: C")
elif(avg>=60&avg<69):
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

14)Write a Python program to determine the eligibility of a candidate for voting based on their age (18 years or older).
age = int(input("Enter age : "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are Eligible for Voting")
else:
    print("You are Not Eligible for Voting")
