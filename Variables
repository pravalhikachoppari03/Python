1)Rules for Python variables
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
-A variable name cannot start with a number
-A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores(A-Z, 0-9 and _)
Variables names are case-sensitive(age,AGE and Age are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

2)Declaration and Initialization of Variables
-Declaration of a variable in a computer programming language is a statement used to specify the variable name and its data type.
-Declaration tells the compiler about the existence of an entity in the program and its location. When you declare a variable, you should also initialize it.

-Initialization is the process of assigning a value to the Variable. Every programming language has its own method of initializing the variable.
-If the value is not assigned to the Variable, then the process is only called a Declaration.

3)Redeclaring variables in Python
In Python, you can redeclare a variable by assigning a new value. This is a fundamental operation in Python.

4)Python Assign Values to Multiple Variables 
a,b,c ="Black"
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

5)Assigning different values to multiple variables
p,q,r = 10,20,30
print(p)
print(q)
print(r)
